# Secondary Stats Distribution (Wow addon)


## Presentation

This addon simply let you know the actual percentile (or proportion) your secondary stats are.

This is handful to quickly get how distributed are your character secondary stats instead of calculating yourself. You can then compate it with simcraft sims, or any good simc api users like [AskMrRobot](https://www.askmrrobot.com/) or [Bloodmallet](https://bloodmallet.com/)

## Contribute

The addon is dead simple and only few lines long. Any contributions are welcomed.
